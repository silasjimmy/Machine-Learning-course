# Machine Learning course
The exercises are from a course offered by Udacity sometime ago but now it has been reviewed but feel free to check the new course [here](https://www.udacity.com/). For those who want to practice with the code i have provided images of the problems in addition to the scripts containing the solution. In case of any questions don't hesitate to contact me.

Happy coding!🤩️🎉️
